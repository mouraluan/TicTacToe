# Java Blackjack Project
This project, developed during the [Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-java-development-bootcamp/) by Professor Rayan Slim at Learn The Part Inc., implements the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe, allowing two players to take turns marking their respective symbols ('X' and 'O') on a 3x3 grid.

### Project Description
The Tic-Tac-Toe project is designed to provide a console-based interactive gaming experience for two players. The players take turns to input their moves, and the program checks for a winning condition after each move.

### Key Features
- Interactive Gameplay: Players are prompted to choose a spot on the board to place their symbol. The game alternates between 'X' and 'O' turns until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.

- Winning Logic: The project includes comprehensive logic to check for a win in rows, columns, and diagonals after each move.

- User Input Validation: The program ensures that players cannot choose a spot that has already been taken, prompting them to choose a different spot.
